# Installing Candycane.js

To get started, we will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on our system.
Then, we will need to install a few dependencies for working in development:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon knex
```

Now, we can start to install the Candycane.js CLI which will help us start new projects

```bash
npm install -g candycane-cli
```

Now that we have Candycane CLI installed on our system, we can begin to start our new application by running the following command in our terminal:

```bash
candycane new todo-app
```

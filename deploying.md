# Deploying To Heroku

Candycane projects come with Heroku support out of the box.

To start, make sure you have an account with Heroku (you can [signup for free](https://signup.heroku.com/)).

Then, commit, publish, and push your completed code to Github or Bitbucket.

Now, you should be able to go to your project on Github and click on the big "Deploy To Heroku Button"!
